1) First things first is to make

- Include a sign in and sign up page very similar to the one that we used for the smart-brain app, this time using mongodb
-> Once this person signs in, we receive an id back from mongo that can be the identifier for that person
-> Can secure the password as well using bcrypt

- In the application itself, obviously need to make everything work so that the messages for each chat show up

DATA ORGANIZATION:
- I am thinking that each chat room will also have an identifier saved with it as well
