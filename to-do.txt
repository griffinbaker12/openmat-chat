1) First things first is to make that login page so that I can generate an ID for each user, store them in the DB in the users collection

- Include a sign in and sign up page very similar to the one that we used for the smart-brain app, this time using mongodb
-> Once this person signs in, we receive an id back from mongo that can be the identifier for that person
-> Can secure the password as well using bcrypt

- In the application itself, obviously need to make everything work so that the messages for each chat show up

DATA ORGANIZATION:
- I am thinking that each chat room will also have an identifier saved with it as well

DIFFERENT IDS THAT I NEED:
- USER ID
- CHAT ID, WHICH CONTAINS THE USER IDS

KEEP IN MIND THAT IN EACH FETCH THAT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE TO OUR BACKEND, THAT INSIDE THE FETCH WE CAN JUST ESSENTIALLY CONSTRUCT THESE ROUTES OURSELF AND WE NEED TO HAVE MATCHING ROUTES IN OUR BACKEND THAT CAN RESPOND WITH WHAT WE WANT THEM TO
